It was established in the territory of the former Fabryczna district. The settlement was first mentioned in 1193, when it was part of medieval Piast-ruled Poland. Throughout its history, the settlement was known by many names – namely Gay, Gayouice, Goiez, Gawicz, Gaiowicz, Gaywicz, Gabitz, and Gajowice. Since medieval times, it was mainly famous for growing vegetables and fruits. This was favored by its proximity to the city. Initially a village, the settlement was incorporated into Breslau (today's Wrocław) in 1868. Gajowice was one of the Wrocław neighborhoods most affected by World War II. Originally, after the war, Gajowice was set to be \"an emergency settlement for the residents of Wrocław evicted from buildings slated for demolition.\" Subsequent planning changes led to the design of a housing development meant for up to 30,000 residents. At that time, this project was the largest housing development in the city's postwar history. ",

It was discovered on 2 September 1980, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Flagstaff, Arizona. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 2.95 hours. It was later named after American astronomer David Tholen. Tholen is a Mars-crossing asteroid, crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.666 AU. Members of this dynamically unstable group are located between the main belt and near-Earth populations. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.5–3.2 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,334 days; semi-major axis of 2.37 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.36 and an inclination of 21° with respect to the ecliptic. In September 1969, it was first observed as 1969 SD at the Argentinian El Leoncito site, extending the body's observation arc by 11 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

It is most often a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or from artificial sources, such as a tanning lamp found in indoor tanning beds. People who deliberately tan their skin by exposure to the sun engage in a passive recreational activity of sun bathing. Some people use chemical products that can produce a tanning effect without exposure to ultraviolet radiation, known as sunless tanning. Moderate exposure to direct sunlight contributes to the production of melanin and vitamin D by the body. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays has negative health effects, including sunburn. Some people tan or sunburn more easily than others. This may be the result of different skin types and natural skin color, and these may be a result of genetics. The term \"tanning\" has a cultural origin, arising from the color tan. Its origin lies in the Western culture of Europe when it became fashionable for young women to seek a less pale complexion (see Cultural history below). ",

      "summary": "Traveller is a science fiction role-playing game first published in 1977 by Game Designers' Workshop. Marc Miller designed Traveller with help from Frank Chadwick, John Harshman, and Loren Wiseman. Editions were published for GURPS, d20, and other role-playing game systems. From its origin and in the currently published systems, the game relied upon six-sided dice for random elements. Traveller has been featured in a few novels and at least two video games. Traveller is a tabletop game where characters journey through star systems, engaging in exploration, ground and space battles, and interstellar trading. The game is influenced by various literary works and emphasizes commerce, sociological stratification, and a mix of low and high technology. The setting is centered around the human-dominated Third Imperium, a feudalistic interstellar empire. Despite the focus on humans, the Traveller universe is cosmopolitan and features various other sophont peoples. The game's history also features the Ancients, a highly advanced race that left behind ruins and artifacts scattered throughout the universe. ",

Their mouths are distinct as well; labeos have a pronounced rostral cap, which covers the upper lip except when feeding.[verification needed] The genus name Labeo is Latin for \"one who has large lips\"; their lips are expanded into thick, sausage-shaped pads which have keratinized edges. Thus, their mouth parts are moderately apomorphic; not as little-developed as in barbs or in Epalzeorhynchos, but neither as extensive as in, for example, Garra or Ptychidio. ",

It was originally established by a group of Anglican women in England in 1875 to address, through Christian values, the problems of working-class unmarried girls and young women who wished to better themselves. The main organisation, GFS England & Wales, ended its relationship with the Church of England in the early 2000s, now operating a secular model that supports girls and young women of all religions and none. In May 1874, the Reverend Thomas Vincent Fosbery (chaplain to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce), together with Mary Elizabeth Townsend (1841–1918), Catharine Tait (1819–1878), Elizabeth Browne (wife of the bishop of Winchester), and Jane Senior (1828–1877), met at Lambeth Palace and agreed on the basis for establishing the Girls' Friendly Society, which officially began its work on 1 January 1875. \"The original rough plan of the Society's work and aim was written down in pencil in a tiny notebook in 1872\", Mary Elizabeth Townsend wrote in 1882 recalling her original concept. She shared her concept with Fosbery who had encouraged her in her previous charitable work with working-class women. Fosbery introduced her to the older women with whom they formed the original steering committee. Mary Elizabeth Townsend was the first president of the GFS and served as such through 1882. She was succeeded by Lady Grey who served from 1883 through 1889, when Townsend again resumed the presidency from 1890 through 1892. Mary Sidgwick Benson, wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was president from 1893 through 1895. ",

After loading many prisoners and booty captured during the plunder of the region onto ships, the Ottoman navy advanced to the Messina Strait, but due to adverse weather conditions, they gave up going to the Naples and Sicily coasts. Returning to Avlonia, Piali Pasha stopped by Nafpaktos and Pylos and fortified the Pylos castle, leaving Occhiali in charge of it with a few galleys.

Installed into power by the Spartans after the Athenian surrender in the Peloponnesian War, the Thirty became known for their tyrannical rule, first being called \"The Thirty Tyrants\" by Polycrates. Although they maintained power for only eight months, their reign resulted in the killing of 5% of the Athenian population, the confiscation of citizens' property, and the exile of other democratic supporters. After the Athenian navy was destroyed at the battle of Aegospotami in 405 BCE, Lysander led the Spartan and Peloponnesian League naval force to Athens for the final destruction of the city. The Athenians prepared for a siege, but without a navy to defend them or import food, many Athenian citizens starved. After the Spartans began cutting them off by occupying Decelea, the Athenians decided to surrender in March 404 BCE. After initial negotiations of surrender failed, Athenian general Theramenes asked the Ecclesia for permission to speak with Lysander, believing that he could get the best possible conditions from the Spartans. His request was granted, and he met with Lysander at Samos, who then sent him to Sparta. Before the Spartan assembly and representatives of the Peloponnesian League, Theramenes negotiated a final surrender of Athens, ending the Peloponnesian War. ",

      "summary": "In computer science and operations research, approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular NP-hard problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one. Approximation algorithms naturally arise in the field of theoretical computer science as a consequence of the widely believed P ≠ NP conjecture. Under this conjecture, a wide class of optimization problems cannot be solved exactly in polynomial time. The field of approximation algorithms, therefore, tries to understand how closely it is possible to approximate optimal solutions to such problems in polynomial time. In an overwhelming majority of the cases, the guarantee of such algorithms is a multiplicative one expressed as an approximation ratio or approximation factor i.e., the optimal solution is always guaranteed to be within a (predetermined) multiplicative factor of the returned solution. However, there are also many approximation algorithms that provide an additive guarantee on the quality of the returned solution. A notable example of an approximation algorithm that provides both is the classic approximation algorithm of Lenstra, Shmoys and Tardos for scheduling on unrelated parallel machines. ",
